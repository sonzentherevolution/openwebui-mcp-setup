## üìù Copy-Paste Prompts

### üî• **For Specific MCP Servers** (Most Common)

```
I want to add this MCP server to Open Web UI. Here is the configuration:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-server-name": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@your/mcp-package"]
    }
  }
}

Can you set this up for me? Read @agentic-setup.md
```

**üëÜ Replace the JSON with your actual MCP server configuration**

### ü§î **When You Need Help Choosing**

```
I want to add MCP tools to Open Web UI but I'm not sure which ones to choose. Can you help me set this up and recommend the best tools for beginners? Read @agentic-setup.md

## üîç How to Find MCP Server Configurations

### Method 1: GitHub Repositories (Most Reliable)

1. **Go to any MCP server's GitHub page**
2. **Look for these sections in the README:**
   - "Installation"
   - "Configuration" 
   - "Claude Desktop setup"
   - "Getting Started"

3. **Find a JSON block that looks like this:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@package/name"]
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Copy the entire JSON block** - that's what you'll give to the AI

### Method 2: Official MCP Server Directory

- **Visit**: [MCP Servers Directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
- **Browse**: Available official servers
- **Click**: On any server to see its setup instructions
- **Copy**: The configuration JSON

### Method 3: NPM Package Search

1. **Search npm** for: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-*`
2. **Click on any package** (e.g., `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`)
3. **Check the README** for installation instructions
4. **Look for Claude Desktop config** - that's what you need!

### Method 4: Community Collections

- **MCP Hub**: Check community-maintained MCP server lists
- **Reddit/Discord**: Look for MCP server sharing threads
- **Blog posts**: Many developers share their MCP setups

## üéâ Real Examples

### Example 1: Context7 Documentation Search
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github.com/upstash/context7-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Filesystem Access
```json

      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "--allowed-directories", "./documents"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Memory Tool
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
